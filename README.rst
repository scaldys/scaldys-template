A template for Python projects managed by Scaldys.

This template is mainly for my own usage, but feel free to try it out or fork it.

Tools
=====

* Python 3.12 or above
* Documentation written in reStructuredText and built with `Sphinx` using the ReadTheDocs template
* Package management with `uv`
* Tests run with `pytest`


Quickstart
==========

  - Download the code of this project as a Zip-file from GitHub.
  - Uncompress the files, and rename the directory with the name of your new project.
  - Open your project folder using your preferred IDE, and replace the project name in all files (see below).
  - Create a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or any provider of your choice.
    Upon completion of the repository creation, instructions are shown to initialize a local working directory,
    configure the remote's URL, and commit and push your files to the repository.


What to replace on project setup
---------------------------------

* `scaldys` case-sensitive

  * strings in all files
  * filenames
  * folder names
